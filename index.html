    <h3>Howdy there!</h3>
    <p>My name's Nick. Born and raised here in the beautiful Puget Sound, I'm a gentleman and scholar of questionable taste. My interests include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.ifpapinball.com/player.php?p=39078">Taking pinball too seriously</a></li>
      <li>Bouncing jerks out of your favorite local bars</li>
      <li>Egging on my fellow <a href="http://www.WeAreEcs.com">Emerald City Supporters</a> on Sounder's matchdays</li>
      <li>Learning to code so I can be the master of my computer, until the machines take over, at which point I hope to be skilled enough at coding that I at least avoid being sent to the <a href="tungsten.jpg">tungsten mines</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>"Hey, you mentioned pinball! Tell me more!"</h3>
    <p id="pinblock">Well, since you asked so nicely! Pinball was invented around a century ago, and evolved from simple games of chance involving a simple plunger device and a number of nails on a backboard that randomly distributed a ball to a final scoring scoop (which would eventually become better known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko">Pachinko</a>), into a highly variable and complex game where a player controls a large silver ball bearing with a number of flippers on a closed table with features such as ramps, orbits, scoops, drop downs, stand ups, rollovers, or pop bumbers. Pinball tables have different rules, strategies, and objectives, but ultimately the goal is to achieve the highest score possible, generally achieved by "hitting lit shots" and preventing the ball from draining - leaving the field of play - which ends the ball in play and eventually the game itself. Each table plays differently - both one model (such as "Earthshaker") from another and one individual table from another of its same make (such as the Earthshaker at one bar versus the Earthshaker at an arcade across town). Success requires a systemic and strategic knowledge of the particular table being played (e.g., "I will avoid starting multiball on this table until I can stack it with at least two modes"), coupled with physical skill to send the ball to the intended target and prevent it from draining.</p>
